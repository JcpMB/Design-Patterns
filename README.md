# Design-Patterns
Just a proof of concept for design patterns implemented in C++

I will cover the main 3 types of patterns: Creational, Structural and Behavioural.

In the specific:

  - Creational: Factory method, Abstract factory, Builder, Prototype, Singleton
  - Structural: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy
  - Behavioural: Chain of responsability, Command, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template method, Visitor
